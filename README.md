# aurelia-todo
A simple CRUD Aurelia app by your friendly neighborhood developer, Jon Bonso. 
This is a yet another ToDo app that enables you to Create, Read, Update and
Delete a task. 

Noticeably, the Aurelia code is cleaner and has significantly less framework-specific annotations/decorators, 
compared with Angular 2.
